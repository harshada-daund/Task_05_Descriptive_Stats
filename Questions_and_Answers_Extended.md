# üß† Prompts and Answers: Strategic Exploration ‚Äì Phase 2

This document contains advanced strategic prompts submitted to the LLM during the second phase of Research Task 5. Each prompt is designed to test the model's ability to analyze and interpret real game data, moving beyond simple facts toward strategic reasoning.

---

### ‚ùì Q1: In which quarter does Syracuse score the most goals, and what might this indicate?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse scored 108 goals in the first quarter‚Äîmore than any other period. This suggests that the team starts strong, potentially due to pre-game preparation and early energy levels. Capitalizing on this trend could involve designing aggressive first-quarter plays.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Correct. The model correctly identified Q1 as the highest-scoring period using available stats.

---

### ‚ùì Q2: Which quarter sees the most goals conceded by Syracuse, and what does it imply?

**LLM Response:**
The fourth quarter had the most goals conceded (55), slightly higher than any other quarter. This may indicate defensive fatigue or reduced efficiency late in the game, which could cost Syracuse in tight matchups.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Accurate and meaningful. The model used verifiable data and suggested actionable improvements.

---

### ‚ùì Q3: How did Syracuse perform in close games (decided by 1 goal or OT)?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse played five close games‚Äîtwo were 1-goal wins, and three were overtime losses. This shows that while Syracuse can win under pressure, they struggled to close out games in overtime. Improving late-game focus and OT scenarios may yield better results.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Strong. Matches exact count and distinguishes between win/loss outcomes.

---

### ‚ùì Q4: Should Syracuse be more concerned about turnovers or ground ball recovery?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse had 317 turnovers vs 334 for opponents‚Äînearly balanced. However, they had fewer ground balls (327) than their opponents (352), suggesting missed recovery opportunities. Enhancing ground ball drills could be more beneficial than focusing on turnover reduction.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Logical comparison. Supports a training focus based on simple statistical gaps.

---

### ‚ùì Q5: What is the shot accuracy rate for Syracuse, and how does it compare to their opponents?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse had 522 shots on goal from 716 attempts (72.9%), while opponents had 367 SOG from 552 shots (66.5%). This demonstrates superior shot precision, which could be further improved through shot selection practice.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Correct. The model calculated percentages accurately and drew a fair conclusion.

---

### ‚ùì Q6: What percentage of Syracuse's goals came from free-position shots?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse scored 65 free-position goals out of 335 total goals, which is about 19.4%. This suggests that nearly one-fifth of their scoring came from set plays‚Äîan area where continued strength could provide a reliable scoring method.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Accurate and data-backed. Good interpretation of the tactical value of set plays.

---

### ‚ùì Q7: Was Syracuse‚Äôs performance stronger at home or away?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse had a home record of 9‚Äì2 and an away record of 5‚Äì2. While both are strong, the home record is slightly better. This suggests a possible home-field advantage, perhaps due to crowd support or familiarity with the field.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Matches game record and gives fair interpretation.

---

### ‚ùì Q8: How many goals did Syracuse score on average per game?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse scored 335 goals across 22 games, giving an average of 15.23 goals per game. This high scoring rate reflects strong offensive capabilities.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Correct. Straightforward math, accurately executed.

---

### ‚ùì Q9: Which game had Syracuse‚Äôs largest margin of victory?

**LLM Response:**
The 20‚Äì5 win against North Carolina and the 19‚Äì4 win over Virginia both featured a 15-goal margin‚Äîthe highest in the season. These games demonstrated Syracuse's peak dominance.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Accurate. Matches scores listed in the dataset.

---

### ‚ùì Q10: What is Syracuse‚Äôs overall overtime record, and how might that affect coaching strategy?

**LLM Response:**
Syracuse lost all three of their overtime games, scoring zero goals in OT. This indicates difficulty executing under sudden-death pressure. Incorporating high-intensity OT simulations into practice may help build late-game composure.

**Evaluation:** ‚úÖ Strong. Uses exact data and links performance to training focus.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

These questions were selected for their ability to:

* Be clearly **answerable from the existing stats**
* Challenge the LLM‚Äôs **analytical and interpretive reasoning**
* Offer **actionable strategic insights** for coaches or analysts

The LLM performed consistently well when the dataset was structured and clear. Strategic questions that required synthesis (like late-game trends or training focus) were answered convincingly. However, continued evaluation is needed when extending beyond basic facts into causality or player-specific recommendations.
