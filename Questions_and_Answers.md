###  Q5: Who was the most improved player this season?

LLM Response: The dataset only contains one season, so direct improvement tracking isn't possible. However, based on impact, **Natalie Smith (44 goals, 10 assists)** and **Katie Goodale (47 draw controls)** stood out as key contributors.

Evaluation:  Partial. The LLM appropriately recognized dataset limitations and provided reasonable alternatives by identifying breakout players.
